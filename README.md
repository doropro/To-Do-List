Realization of a to do list.


## Date :

Performed the week of March 18, 2019 as a trainee at BeCode.

## Technology used :

+ PHP/SQL

## Progression :

functionalities : completed

Design : to work

## Instructions:

Creates a basic and reliable task management tool. The interface is subdivided into two parts:

+ upper part: the list of tasks to be done, with for each task, a checkbox. When a task is done, we check the task and then press a "Save" button that refreshes the list by blocking the completed task and putting it in the "archived" area.

+ lower part: a small form to add a task (a "textarea" field and the "submit" button).

## Primary objective :

When processing the forms, after sanitization and validation, the tasks must be stored in a "todos" table of a "todolist" database.
When displaying the tasks we will search them in the database.
